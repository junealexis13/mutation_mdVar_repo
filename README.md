This repository contains necessary files to be used for the following:
- Python Scripts for SWISS-MODEL expasy submission query
- Bash scripts for Automatic FOLDx modelling
- Algorithm for automated molecular docking of models and hesperidin using AutoDock Tools CLI
- FOLDx Modelling configuration file templates
- SLURM Submit algorithm for COARE HPC computing
- MD Parameter files (.mdp) for Thermostat, Barostat, and MDRUN files
